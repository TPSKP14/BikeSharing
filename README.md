# BikeSharing

OVERVIEW

The purpose of this project is to determine whether a bikeshare program would be a feasible investment for Des Moines, Iowa.  We examined data from CitiBike in New York city, and constructed a multitude of visualizations to best display the benefits and practicality of the bike sharing business model.

Results
While Des Moines is a far more sparsely populated area then New York City, if scaled properly, the bike sharing business model could be successful.  Des Moines investors would be able to benefit by having easy access to the things that made CitiBike so successful, and the obstacles they have had to overcome.  One such obstacle would be repair times, as displayed by the below the ideal timing of repairs is late at night and early in the morning.  After the 8pm rush hour and before the 7 am rush hour seems to be the ideal window

The most popular locations directly coincide with population density and tourism, as shown below.  The West side is seemingly more bike path friendly, and as a result we see a higher concentration of rides on the West Coast of Manhattan

Nearly all rides are finished within the hour, which should help with pricing structure

Males appear to be about 3 times more likely to checkout bikes, but the ride times between males and females are about the same

As in the earlier image for bike repair times, we can see below that the most popular times for riders are the morning and evening rush hour periods

As was the same findings with gender and length of ride, we can see in the below that timing of rides has little to do with gender as well

There is little variance in the timing of when customers rent, but what is apparent is that male subscribers are the largest proportion of bike sharing participants and stay fairly consistent with their bike sharing patterns

SUMMARY

After observing the above, we can comeaway with a few key takeaways

-The bike sharing program in New York City is extremely successful.  Most notably, it is most successful with males who opt for a subscription and use their CitiBikes on a nearly daily basis.  Most likely, these bikes are used by commuters in the city center, so Des Moines should try and place bikes as close as possible to work places so commuters can benefit

-Nearly all rides end within an hour, pricing should reflect as such.  A tiered pricing structure that increases as time goes on would be most benefitial to keep turnover of the bikes as efficient as possible.  There should be an algorithm to determine the penalty for extended bike rentals and the correalated charge,

-The rush hour windows were by far the most trafficked times.  Des Moines will have to have bikes placed efficiently around their neighborhoods in order to give commuters the best access to the bikes
